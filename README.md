# centro-theme
WordPress + BuddyPress Theme

## About this theme
Centro is a theme that aims to be responsive and accessibly on multiple devices. It's been a learning curve and has some pitfalls but for standard(ish) devices and viewports the theme renders 
well and exposes the core functionality of both WordPress and BuddyPress. To learn a bit more about the development of this theme see [this](http://buddycore.com/developing-centro-theme/) page.

## What works and what doesn't?

### Works
WordPress Posts, WordPress Pages, WordPress Customizer, BuddyPress Activity (and related functionality), BuddyPress Members (and related functionality)

### Customisations
Work on the customizer is still being completed but you'll be able to change the colours, add logos, include your analytics codes and more.

## Responsiveness
Learning from the development of Surface Theme there have been some conscious UI changes to enhance UX. For 1:1 pixel ratio devices this theme is almost rock.

## Why put an unfinished theme live?
It's a work in progress, each feature has its own merits for the platforms namely WordPress and BuddyPress. I like these features and so do many others, releasing them in stages allows me 
to do a better job.

## Will you work on this if I pay you?
Of course.

## Will you work on this even if I don't pay you?
The users will shape the development of this master branch, I do help people on the BuddyPress.org/support forums. So yes, I will help you there for free or on BuddyCore.com
