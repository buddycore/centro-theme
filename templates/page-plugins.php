                <p>
                Plugins for WordPress allow you to extend the functionality of the system and preserve those settings across themes which are active.

                There are no plugins available at the moment, but I would like to build some custom post type plugins to be utilised with both Surface and Centro.

                <h2>When will you build these plugins?</h2>
                <p>
                I'm currently developing Centro which will take up a lot of my time into the early months of 2017, after that I will consolidate both my themes which may require a complete optimisation and rewrite.
                </p>
                <p>After those goals have been reached I will look into developing these plugins to extend the functionality.</p>

                There has been some requests for third-party plugin support for Surface to date, I will look at this in the future based on user feedback.
